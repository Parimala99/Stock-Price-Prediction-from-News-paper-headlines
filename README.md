# Stock-Prediction-from-News-paper-headlines

In this project , I tried to predict whether whether a particular company will have hike in their stock prices , through the headlines of the newspaper. I have used a newspaper headline data with labels. Since the labels are given in data , This becomes a supervised learning technique. I have created a random forest classifier to predict the hike in stock prices.

After intializing the model , to fit the textual data , I used two different methods.

1. CountVectorizer  
2. TfidiVectorizer.

Then I evaluted the metrics for both. I also used MultinomialNB to see whether it predicts with better accuracy or not.
